# C2Rust Samples Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of C programming projects of varying sizes and complexities. These samples are specifically curated for training purposes for the [Sorcestone](https://github.com/your-project-link) project, which performs semi-automatic translation of C programs into Rust.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Provide a diverse set of C programs for testing and improving the C-to-Rust translation process
- Serve as a training ground for the Sorcestone translation tool
- Demonstrate the capabilities of automated C to Rust code conversion

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have a C program that you believe would be a valuable addition to our sample collection, we encourage you to:

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your C program to an appropriate directory
3. Submit a pull request

### Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure your C program is well-documented
- Include a brief description of the program's functionality
- Provide any necessary build instructions or dependencies
- If possible, include the expected Rust translation output

## License

Each original C project may retain its own license. However, any files generated during the migration process are distributed under the MIT License.
